The swiftlet has a high economic value due to its nests made of swiftlet saliva, which are considered as the main raw material for making traditional food and drinks. However, calling swiftlets is not as easy as flipping a switch. In this article, we will discuss several ways to call swiftlets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">Calling Swiftlets Using Sound Recordings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common way to call Swiftlets is by using sound recordings of the birds. These recordings can be purchased or downloaded from the internet, and then played using a speaker or music player. The sound recordings can attract the attention of Swiftlets in the targeted area and are usually used at night when the birds are searching for food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">How to Attract Swiftlets Using Scent<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from using bird calls, you can also attract swiftlets using swiftlet perfume. Swiftlet perfume is an aroma that is favored by swiftlets and can catch their attention in the targeted area. Swiftlet perfume comes in various forms, such as sprays or burning scent. You can apply swiftlet perfume around the desired area to attract swiftlets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">How to Attract Swiftlets by Making an Artificial Nest<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to attract swiftlets is by creating an artificial nest. The nest can be made from materials similar to those used by the swiftlets to build their own nests. For example, the artificial nest can be made from a mixture of cement and swiftlet saliva, and then installed in the desired location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that creating an artificial nest can be a difficult process that requires specialized knowledge of the structure and layout of swiftlet nests. Additionally, this process can be time-consuming and costly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">How to Attract Swiftlets by Making an Light Source<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to attract swiftlets is by using a light source. Swiftlets tend to fly at night when they search for food. Therefore, using a light source such as a lamp or a flashlight can attract swiftlets&#8217; attention around the desired area. Typically, the light source is directed towards the ceiling and walls of buildings or structures where swiftlets commonly make their nests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">How to Call Swiftlets by Mimicking their Sounds<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to call swiftlets is by imitating their sound. You can learn how to imitate swiftlet sounds through the internet or by asking for assistance from bird experts. However, make sure not to imitate the sound of swiftlets near their nests, as it can disturb their activities and disrupt the reproduction of swiftlets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Calling swiftlets requires an understanding of their behavior and needs. Some ways to call swiftlets include using sound recordings, swiftlet perfume, or making artificial nests. Calling swiftlets can be done using various methods, such as using sound recordings, swiftlet perfume, light sources, or imitating swiftlet sounds. However, be sure to consider factors such as timing and location when calling swiftlets to avoid disturbing their breeding or feeding activities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The swiftlet is known as a bird that lives in tropical areas and is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia.
