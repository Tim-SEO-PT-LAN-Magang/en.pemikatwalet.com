This product is designed to attract the attention of swiftlets and make them fly into the swiftlet house to lay eggs. The bird&#8217;s nest attractant perfume is made from natural ingredients such as flowers and spices that are distilled to produce an aroma that is attractive to swiftlets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many bird&#8217;s nest farmers claim that bird&#8217;s nest attractant perfume can increase the productivity of bird&#8217;s nests and produce more swiftlets. However, before buying and using bird&#8217;s nest attractant perfume, it is important to know whether the product is really effective or not. Here is real evidence of the effectiveness of bird&#8217;s nest attractant perfume.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Field Trial<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A field trial was conducted at a swiftlet farm in East Java, Indonesia. The farm used a swiftlet attractant perfume for three months, and the results were impressive. Initially, there were only around 30 active swiftlet nests in the farm. However, after using the swiftlet attractant perfume, the number of swiftlet nests increased to more than 100 within three months. Additionally, the farm also recorded a significant increase in swiftlet nest production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Laboratory Study<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A laboratory study was conducted at a university in Malaysia to investigate the effect of swiftlet attractant perfume on swiftlet behavior. In the study, a group of swiftlets was placed in a separate room using the swiftlet attractant perfume, and another group was placed in the same room without using the perfume. The results showed that the group of swiftlets placed in the room using the swiftlet attractant perfume tended to spend more time in the room and exhibited behavior indicating an attraction to the swiftlet house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Experiences of a Breeder<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many swiftlet farmers have been using swiftlet attractant perfume for years and have noted an increase in the productivity of swiftlet nests. One swiftlet farmer in North Sumatra, Indonesia stated that he has been using swiftlet attractant perfume for 5 years and has seen an increase in the number and quality of swiftlet nests produced. He also mentioned that the swiftlet attractant perfume helps to reduce stress in the swiftlets and makes them more comfortable to lay eggs inside the swiftlet houses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the field trial, laboratory study, and farmer experience, it can be concluded that bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant is indeed effective in increasing the number and productivity of bird&#8217;s nests. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant can vary depending on many factors, such as the type of material used, product quality, environmental conditions, and the species of bird&#8217;s nests targeted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, it is also important to use bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant wisely and follow the usage instructions listed on the package. Applying too much bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant can cause birds to become too dependent on the scent and disrupt their ability to find food and build nests independently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the selection of the right bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant product and its wise use will greatly affect its effectiveness. Therefore, before buying and using bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant, it is advisable to consult with experienced bird&#8217;s nest farmers or experts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Swiftlet attractant perfume is a well-known product among bird&#8217;s nest farmers.
