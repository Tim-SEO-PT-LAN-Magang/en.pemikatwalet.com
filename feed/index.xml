<p>Swiftlet attractant perfume is a well-known product among bird&#8217;s nest farmers. This product is designed to attract the attention of swiftlets and make them fly into the swiftlet house to lay eggs. The bird&#8217;s nest attractant perfume is made from natural ingredients such as flowers and spices that are distilled to produce an aroma that is attractive to swiftlets.</p>



<p>Many bird&#8217;s nest farmers claim that bird&#8217;s nest attractant perfume can increase the productivity of bird&#8217;s nests and produce more swiftlets. However, before buying and using bird&#8217;s nest attractant perfume, it is important to know whether the product is really effective or not. Here is real evidence of the effectiveness of bird&#8217;s nest attractant perfume.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">Field Trial</h2>



<p>A field trial was conducted at a swiftlet farm in East Java, Indonesia. The farm used a swiftlet attractant perfume for three months, and the results were impressive. Initially, there were only around 30 active swiftlet nests in the farm. However, after using the swiftlet attractant perfume, the number of swiftlet nests increased to more than 100 within three months. Additionally, the farm also recorded a significant increase in swiftlet nest production.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">Laboratory Study</h2>



<p>A laboratory study was conducted at a university in Malaysia to investigate the effect of swiftlet attractant perfume on swiftlet behavior. In the study, a group of swiftlets was placed in a separate room using the swiftlet attractant perfume, and another group was placed in the same room without using the perfume. The results showed that the group of swiftlets placed in the room using the swiftlet attractant perfume tended to spend more time in the room and exhibited behavior indicating an attraction to the swiftlet house.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">Experiences of a Breeder</h2>



<p>Many swiftlet farmers have been using swiftlet attractant perfume for years and have noted an increase in the productivity of swiftlet nests. One swiftlet farmer in North Sumatra, Indonesia stated that he has been using swiftlet attractant perfume for 5 years and has seen an increase in the number and quality of swiftlet nests produced. He also mentioned that the swiftlet attractant perfume helps to reduce stress in the swiftlets and makes them more comfortable to lay eggs inside the swiftlet houses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Based on the field trial, laboratory study, and farmer experience, it can be concluded that bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant is indeed effective in increasing the number and productivity of bird&#8217;s nests. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant can vary depending on many factors, such as the type of material used, product quality, environmental conditions, and the species of bird&#8217;s nests targeted.</p>



<p>In addition, it is also important to use bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant wisely and follow the usage instructions listed on the package. Applying too much bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant can cause birds to become too dependent on the scent and disrupt their ability to find food and build nests independently.</p>



<p>In this case, the selection of the right bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant product and its wise use will greatly affect its effectiveness. Therefore, before buying and using bird&#8217;s nest perfume attractant, it is advisable to consult with experienced bird&#8217;s nest farmers or experts.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gambar-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-455" width="944" height="631"/></figure>



<p>The swiftlet is known as a bird that lives in tropical areas and is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. The swiftlet has a high economic value due to its nests made of swiftlet saliva, which are considered as the main raw material for making traditional food and drinks. However, calling swiftlets is not as easy as flipping a switch. In this article, we will discuss several ways to call swiftlets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">Calling Swiftlets Using Sound Recordings</h2>



<p>The most common way to call Swiftlets is by using sound recordings of the birds. These recordings can be purchased or downloaded from the internet, and then played using a speaker or music player. The sound recordings can attract the attention of Swiftlets in the targeted area and are usually used at night when the birds are searching for food.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">How to Attract Swiftlets Using Scent</h2>



<p>Apart from using bird calls, you can also attract swiftlets using swiftlet perfume. Swiftlet perfume is an aroma that is favored by swiftlets and can catch their attention in the targeted area. Swiftlet perfume comes in various forms, such as sprays or burning scent. You can apply swiftlet perfume around the desired area to attract swiftlets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">How to Attract Swiftlets by Making an Artificial Nest</h2>



<p>Another way to attract swiftlets is by creating an artificial nest. The nest can be made from materials similar to those used by the swiftlets to build their own nests. For example, the artificial nest can be made from a mixture of cement and swiftlet saliva, and then installed in the desired location.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that creating an artificial nest can be a difficult process that requires specialized knowledge of the structure and layout of swiftlet nests. Additionally, this process can be time-consuming and costly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">How to Attract Swiftlets by Making an Light Source</h2>



<p>Another way to attract swiftlets is by using a light source. Swiftlets tend to fly at night when they search for food. Therefore, using a light source such as a lamp or a flashlight can attract swiftlets&#8217; attention around the desired area. Typically, the light source is directed towards the ceiling and walls of buildings or structures where swiftlets commonly make their nests.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">How to Call Swiftlets by Mimicking their Sounds</h2>



<p>Another way to call swiftlets is by imitating their sound. You can learn how to imitate swiftlet sounds through the internet or by asking for assistance from bird experts. However, make sure not to imitate the sound of swiftlets near their nests, as it can disturb their activities and disrupt the reproduction of swiftlets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Calling swiftlets requires an understanding of their behavior and needs. Some ways to call swiftlets include using sound recordings, swiftlet perfume, or making artificial nests. Calling swiftlets can be done using various methods, such as using sound recordings, swiftlet perfume, light sources, or imitating swiftlet sounds. However, be sure to consider factors such as timing and location when calling swiftlets to avoid disturbing their breeding or feeding activities.</p>
